# CPE_2016_Matchstick

EPITECH first year project.

This project is based on a very famous game based on matchsticks. There is a certain number of matchstick lines. The two players take turns; each player can, on a same line, take one or several matchsticks. The losing player is the one to take the last matchstick.

- **Codded primarly in C**

## Requirements

 - [A Linux distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) or [Apple's macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS)
 - [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
 - [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

## Compilation

Navigate to the root of the repository from your Terminal and run `make` to build the executable file.

## How to use

Lunch the Binary in the root of the project.

The game asks you to chose a line, then the amount of stick you want to remove starting from the right of the line. The goal is to make the AI remove the last match. Good luck !!
